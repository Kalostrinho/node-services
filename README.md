# NODE SERVICES
#### An awesome CLI tool to create a mocked RESTful service and execute few JS tests for the service spawned

## IMPROVEMENTS:
* Uses a `Node CLI` application instead of plain shell commands
* `Clean up` now only removes the images created by this application
* `Cadence and speed` is wa better with `Node`

## PRE-REQUISITES
1. Node (12+)
1. Docker (18+)

## EASIEST WAY TO INSTALL PRE-REQUISITES
1. Install [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) :beer:
1. Use HomeBrew to install NodeJS 
```
brew update
brew install node
```
3. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## HOW TO USE
1. Clone the repository to your local
1. Perform a `npm install`
1. Perform a `npm link`
1. Run `service-now` to set things up
1. If everything went properly, at the end you'll see a brief summary of the services spawned.
1. Enjoy :smiley:
